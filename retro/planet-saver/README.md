## NPC Behaviour
During the house level, players must be cautious of two NPCs who will actively search for them if they are detected wandering around the premises. 
These NPCs are equipped with NavMeshAgents and will become hostile if the player is in their line of sight without any obstructions.

## Eco-points
In the house level, progress is tied to eco-points, which determine the objects you can modify. 
Initially, you cannot alter many items, and your ability to make changes is directly proportional to your eco-points. 
Each time you make a change, you earn additional eco-points.

## Save/Load Mechanics
The game, Help Me I'm Dying, offers a Save/Load mechanic that automatically updates a local file and encrypts it once significant progress has been made, 
ensuring a seamless gameplay experience.

## Settings Menu
