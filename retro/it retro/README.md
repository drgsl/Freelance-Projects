# It's Retro O'Clock 🕹️

Welcome to "It's Retro O'Clock," a Unity game that features multiple open world spaces and minigames. 
To unlock the next space, players must visit multiple minigames in each area.

## 🚶 NPC Behaviour
The game's open-world mode features dynamic pedestrian and vehicular traffic with intelligent pathfinding. 
The pedestrian AI moves only along designated sidewalks and crosswalks, while vehicular traffic follows the city's road network. 
All non-playable characters (NPCs) move towards randomized targets with a unique and intuitive NavMeshAgent component that facilitates smooth and realistic movement.

## 🔮 Portal Level
The Portal Level features a unique gameplay experience where players can visually traverse through portals, created using the innovative combination of Cameras and Render Textures.

## 🎯 Raycasting
I utilized Raycasting in various scenarios throughout the game. For example, hostile enemies can detect if the player is within their camera's field of view and then perform a raycast to check if any obstacles obstruct their line of sight to the player.
