# üõ†Ô∏è Circuit Diagram Builder
Welcome to Circuit Diagram Builder, a project developed in C++ as part of my Introduction to Programming Course during my Bachelor's studies.

## üìÅ Description
This project allows you to create and visualize electronic circuits using a graphical user interface. You can add different components such as resistors, capacitors, and LEDs, and connect them using wires to create a functioning circuit.

Please note that this project is still in development and does not yet have a simulation feature.

## üöÄ Getting Started
To use this project, you will need to have Code::Blocks installed with the [WinBGIm](https://home.cs.colorado.edu/~main/bgi/dev-c++/) library.

### Building From Source (using Code::Blocks)
To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the [Electron.cbp](https://github.com/BobuDragos/Circuit-Diagram-Builder/blob/main/Electron/Electron.cbp) file with Code::Blocks.
3. Build and run the project.

### Windows Executable
If you just want to execute the software, you can find [this Windows executable](https://github.com/BobuDragos/Circuit-Diagram-Builder/blob/main/Electron/bin/Debug/Electron%20prof.exe) under `Bin/Debug`.

### Linux Building from Source
You'll have to build the [c++ Source Code](https://github.com/BobuDragos/Circuit-Diagram-Builder/blob/main/Electron/unitedCode.cpp) using `gcc`

If you encounter any issues, feel free to open an issue in the repository.
